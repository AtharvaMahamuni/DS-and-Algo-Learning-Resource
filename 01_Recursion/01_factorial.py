* The Factorial is the product of all Numbers from N to 1

* eg. Suppose the Factorial of 6 is to beCalculated which is denoted as 6!
 The Solution will be 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720

* So if you have keen observation you can see the pattern

6*5!
6*5*4!
6*5*4*3!
6*5*4*3*2!
6*5*4*3*2*1!

As we know 1! = 1

1*2*3*4*5*6
2*3*4*5*6
6*4*5*6
24*5*6
120*6
720

Thus 720 is the Answer.

* We Solve a much Bigger Problems by solving Smaller Problems.

To find factorial of a number we will see a function, we will solve this problem using Recursion.
